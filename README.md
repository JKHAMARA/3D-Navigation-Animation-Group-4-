# 3D Scene Navigation, Animation, and Particle System

This project is a 3D graphics demonstration developed for a Computer Graphics (year 4) exam at the University of Makeni, showcasing keyframe animation, particle systems, and user-controlled 3D scene navigation.

## Project Description

This project implements the following features:

* **3D Scene Navigation:**
    * User-controlled camera movement using mouse and keyboard input.
    * Navigation through a 3D environment.
* **Keyframe Animation:**
    * Basic keyframe animation, demonstrating object rotation or translation over time.
    * Example implementation of a rotating cube.
* **Particle System:**
    * Implementation of a particle system to simulate visual effects.
    * Simulations for rain, fire, and snow are included.

## Technologies Used

* **C++:** Core programming language.
* **FreeGLUT:** For window management and OpenGL context.
* **OpenGL:** For 3D graphics rendering.
* **Code::Blocks:** Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

## Build Instructions

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    * Code::Blocks with a configured MinGW compiler.
    * FreeGLUT library installed and configured.
2.  **Open the Project:**
    * Open the `*.cbp` project file in Code::Blocks.
4.  **Build and Run:**
    * Build the project using Code::Blocks.
    * Run the executable.

## Controls

* **Keyboard:**
    * `W`: Move camera forward.
    * `S`: Move camera backward.
    * `A`: Move camera left.
    * `D`: Move camera right.
    * `ESCAPE`: Exit the application.
* **Mouse:**
    * Mouse movement changes the camera angle.

## Project Structure

* **`*.cbp`:** Code::Blocks project file.
* **`.gitignore`:** Specifies files to ignore in Git version control.
